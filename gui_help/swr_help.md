# ***Soil Water Reserve Calculation***

CC: Camp Capacity

PWP: Permanent Wilting Point

RRT: Root Radial Thickness

The data can be introduced from the WaterpyBal dataset (generally used for scenarios with time-varied soil properties that is already introduced into the dataset in step 1), a multi-band raster or as a constant value value.


&nbsp;

>***IMPORTANT NOTE:*** All the rasters that is used in a WaterpyBal project have to have the exact same Geographic coordinate system, pixel resolution, length and width. We recommend [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org) as a free and Open Source software for shapefile to tif conversations, creating multiband tifs, raster resampling, etc.
